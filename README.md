## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Run Locally (Static Only)

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the landing page.

### Option 2: Run with Backend

This project optionally fetches data from a backend running on `http://localhost:3000`.

You‚Äôll need to:

1. Create an API that supports:
   - `GET /api/products` ‚Äì returns a list of product objects.
   - `POST /api/cart` ‚Äì accepts product ID and quantity to update the cart.
2. Start the server.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If the backend is not available, the page still loads predefined static product data.
